  <h1>Company Profits – Financial Statement Analysis</h1>

  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Matplotlib, Structured Data Definitions</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project analyzes the financial statements of major companies to understand
    long-term profitability trends. The goal was to visualize how net profit margins
    evolve over time and identify patterns of growth, stability, or decline using
    structured data and clear visual representations.

  <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset consists of financial records for multiple companies across several
    years. Each record includes the year, company name, sector, market capitalization,
    revenue, and net profit margin. These structured fields allow the program to perform
    meaningful time-series analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using Python, the data is processed through a main analysis function that computes
    net profit margins and applies a three-year moving average to smooth short-term
    fluctuations. The results are then visualized using Matplotlib to highlight overall
    profitability trends and long-term growth behavior.
  </p>

  <h2>Code Showcase</h2>
  <pre><code>
# Example data structure used in the project

def analyze(loc:CompanyRecordList, company: str) -> Produced:
    """
    Selects only the chosen company's rows,
    sorts them by year,
    computes NPM series, YoY changes,
    moving average, CAGR, and correlation.
    Returns a Produced.
    """
    #return [] #stub 
    #template is based on CompanyRecordList and an additional parameter company
    #filtered stores the produced List
    
    filtered = []
    for cr in loc:
        if cr.company == company:
            filtered = filtered + [cr]

    #helper functions 
    sorted_list = sort_by_year(filtered)
    years = extract_years(sorted_list)
    npm = extract_npm(sorted_list)
    yoy = compute_yoy(npm)
    ma3 = moving_average_3(npm)
    cagr = compute_cagr(sorted_list)
    corr = pearson_corr(sorted_list)

    return Produced(years, npm, yoy, ma3, cagr, corr)

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    This project helped me strengthen my understanding of structured data modeling
    and time-series analysis. I learned how to design clear data definitions that make
    analysis and visualization more reliable and meaningful.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also improved my ability to interpret financial metrics, recognize long-term
    trends, and communicate insights visually using clean and readable plots.
