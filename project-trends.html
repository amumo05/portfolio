  <h1>Stock Trend Analysis (2020–2025)</h1>

  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Data Analysis, Matplotlib, CSV Processing</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project analyzes stock market trends from 2020 to 2025, a period marked by
    significant economic disruption and recovery. The goal was to study how different
    companies responded to market volatility and external events by combining numerical
    analysis with real-world market context.

  <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
  <p>
    The analysis uses stock data collected across multiple years and companies, focusing
    on key indicators such as average price change, earnings growth, and overall growth
    scores. Each company’s yearly performance is evaluated independently and then compared
    across the same time periods.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond numerical trends, this project incorporates qualitative market context such as
    post-pandemic recovery, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic conditions. This
    approach allowed me to interpret not only <em>what</em> the trends were, but also
    <em>why</em> certain patterns emerged.
  </p>

  <p>
    The resulting visualizations highlight long-term trajectories, periods of volatility,
    and cross-company differences, providing a clearer understanding of how external
    factors influence market performance.

  <h2>Code Showcase</h2>
  <pre><code>
# Example logic used to compute yearly growth scores
   def analyze_price_trend_with_interpretation(records: StockRecordList, company: str) -> None:
    """
    Analyzes price trend, prints interpretation, and plots the result.
    """
    analysis = build_price_trend_analysis(records, company)
    explanation = interpret_price_trend(analysis)

    print("Price Trend Interpretation:")
    print(explanation)

    plot_price_trend(analysis)
 </code></pre>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    This project significantly improved my ability to work with time-series data and
    compare trends across multiple dimensions. I learned how to design metrics that
    balance different indicators and how to interpret results within a broader economic
    context.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also gained confidence in translating complex datasets into clear visual stories
    and strengthened my analytical thinking by connecting data-driven results to
    real-world events.
