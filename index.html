<h2> <p style="color:rgb(98, 192, 223)"> About Me </p></h2>

I am a second-year student at the University of British Columbia, currently exploring 
potential majors within Computer Science. My interest in CS is broad and has developed over time, 
beginning in Grade 7 with robotics, which initially sparked my curiosity in cognition and systems. During high school, 
I transitioned into programming-focused coursework, and more recently I have developed a strong interest in data analysis using 
Python. This progression has allowed me to gain exposure to multiple areas of computer science while keeping my academic focus flexible
and open to growth. I work effectively in team-oriented environments, having completed several group-intensive courses at UBC, including 
SCIE 113 and LING 100, both of which emphasized long-term collaboration, presentations, and project-based work. In addition to teamwork, 
I have demonstrated leadership by stepping into instructional roles during classical dance, painting classes, and even high school
mathematics sessions when needed. I am known for being approachable, collaborative, and dependable, and I am highly motivated to continue 
expanding my knowledge beyond the classroom, as I believe meaningful learning extends well beyond structured coursework.
